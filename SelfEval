Changes done in the code:
1. Instead of writing all the clauses in the file at a time using "output_strings" vector, we are writing each clause to a file directly when we encounter it. 
    This is done because the RAM was getting filled in the previous method
    just replaced all occurences of 

    a. " output_strings.push_back(ss.str());" -> "//  output_strings.push_back(ss.str());" 
    b. "//satInputFile<<ss.str();" -> "satInputFile<<ss.str()"

    just uncommented the code. 

2. Checked indegree and outdegree to remove some clauses. The code to measure indegree and outdegree was already present in the original submission as well.
So the changes 
"
if( (Gs.nodes[i]->indegree > Gl.nodes[j]->indegree) || (Gs.nodes[i]->outdegree > Gl.nodes[j]->outdegree)){
                stringstream ss;
                ss<< "-"<< (Gs.nodes[i]->id - 1)* cols +  (Gl.nodes[j]->id -1) + 1  << " 0\n";
                // output_strings.push_back(ss.str());
                satInputFile<<ss.str();
                clauseCount++;
                continue;
            }
"
this code was added.

We have tested the code on our Laptop with Ubuntu 18.04 with 16 GB RAM and it works fine as will be demonstrated in demo.
